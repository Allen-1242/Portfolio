The extracted features are meant to be fed into simple explainable models such as linear or logistic regressions. This R package is useful in the field of explainable modelling as a way to understand variable behavior.\n\nStructuralDecompose\n\n\nStructuralDecompose\nStructuralDecompose Documentation\n\nThis R package explains the behavior of a time series by decomposing it into its trend, seasonality and residuals. It is built to perform very well in the presence of significant level shifts."
