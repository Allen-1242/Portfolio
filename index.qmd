Hi, I'm Allen Sunny. I am a masters student at the University of Maryland College Park.  I build human-centered AI systems and conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, public services, and digital accountability. I am currently finishing my masters thesis under the guidence of Professor Ido Sivan-Sevilla.

This site showcases my coursework, research papers, and code projects.

- [TangledFeatures](https://allen-1242.github.io/TangledFeatures/)
- [TangledFeatures Documentation](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/TangledFeatures/TangledFeatures.pdf)

TangledFeatures is a feature selection algorithm that extracts features in highly correlated spaces. The extracted features are meant to be fed into simple explainable models such as linear or logistic regressions. The package is useful in the field of explainable modelling as a way to understand variable behavior.
