Hi, I'm Allen Sunny, a master's student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I build human-centered AI systems and conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, public services, and digital accountability.  I'm currently finishing my thesis under the guidance of [Professor Ido Sivan-Sevilla](https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/ido-sivan-sevilla/).

This site showcases my research, projects, and links to my code repositories.
