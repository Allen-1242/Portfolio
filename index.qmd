Hi, I'm Allen Sunny. I am a masters student at the University of Maryland College Park.  I build human-centered AI systems and conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, public services, and digital accountability. I am currently finishing my masters thesis under the guidance of Professor [Ido Sivan-Sevilla](https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/ido-sivan-sevilla/).

This site showcases my coursework, research papers, and links to my code.

TangledFeatures is a feature selection algorithm that extracts features in highly correlated spaces. The extracted features are meant to be fed into simple explainable models such as linear or logistic regressions. This R package is useful in the field of explainable modelling as a way to understand variable behavior.
