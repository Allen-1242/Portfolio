Hi, I'm Allen Sunny, a master's student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I build human-centered AI systems and conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, public services, and digital accountability.  I'm currently finishing my thesis under the guidance of [Professor Ido Sivan-Sevilla](https://ischool.umd.edu/directory/ido-sivan-sevilla/).

This site showcases my research, projects, and links to my code repositories.

## 📚 Research Projects

### Human-Centered AI for the Public Sector  
Developing a framework and prototype to support the responsible deployment of AI in public institutions.
This work draws on case studies of past failures, emphasizes human-centered design, and proposes a roadmap
for post-deployment evaluation and accountability.

- 📄 *Thesis (in progress)*  
- 💻 *Prototype coming soon*

### Trust in Transparency: How Explainable AI Shapes User Perceptions  
A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews that explores how users emotionally respond
to AI-generated explanations. The findings highlight that trust is shaped not just by transparency, but also by reliability, clarity, and perceived control.  
 - 📄 [Paper](papers/INST_808__User_AI_Research_Final-2.pdf)

### Explainability and Trust in AI: A Quantitative Approach  
A survey based study that evaluates how different types of AI explanations influence user perceptions
of fairness, trust, and decision legitimacy.  
- 📄 [Paper](papers/INST_808__User_AI_Research.pdf)

### Oxford AI Monitoring System  
A lightweight, automated web scraper designed to track corporate adoption of foundation models.
This tool supports transparency and governance efforts by mapping real-time deployment trends across
public-facing websites.
